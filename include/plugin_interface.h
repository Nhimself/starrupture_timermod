// v19: Introduced IPluginSelf.  MIN bumped to 19.
// v20: Added OnBeforeWorldEndPlay / OnAfterWorldEndPlay.  MIN remains 19.
// v21: Added IPluginNativePointers.  MIN remains 19.
// v22: Added IPluginHttpServer (hooks->HttpServer).
//   Static file route registration (AddRoute/RemoveRoute), raw-request
//      filter hook (RegisterOnRawRequest/UnregisterOnRawRequest), and
//  raw-response route registration (AddRawRoute/RemoveRawRoute).
//      URL scheme: /<pluginName>/<routeName>/...  (case-insensitive).
//      Static files are served from <exe_dir>\Plugins\<pluginName>\<folderName>\.
//      Raw-response routes let plugins handle arbitrary URL prefixes and write
//      any response body + content-type directly (e.g. JSON API endpoints).
//   Server builds only; nullptr on client/generic builds.
//      MIN remains 19.
// v23 - SR Hotfix update 22/04/2026 118961
// v24: Added scaling/metrics functions to IModLoaderImGui (GetFontSize, GetTextLineHeight,
//      GetTextLineHeightWithSpacing, GetFrameHeight, GetFrameHeightWithSpacing, CalcTextSize,
//      SetWindowFontScale, GetContentRegionAvail, GetDisplaySize).
//      Added PluginWindowHints struct and windowHints field to PluginWidgetDesc.
//      MIN remains 23.
// v31: Added extra_window_flags to PluginWindowHints.
//      Allows plugins to pass additional ImGuiWindowFlags (e.g. NoTitleBar, NoResize).
//      0 = no extra flags (default behaviour unchanged). MIN remains 26.
// v32: Added IPluginClientSessionInfo (client only, null on server/generic).
//      Exposes GetSessionOnlineMode, IsMultiplayer, IsServer query functions.
// v33: Added pluginTarget field to PluginInfo. Every plugin must now declare
//      PLUGIN_TARGET_CLIENT or PLUGIN_TARGET_SERVER. The loader rejects plugins
//      that don't match the current build target.
// v34: Game had an update, needed interface bump
// v35: Added layout/sidebar functions to IModLoaderImGui:
//      BeginChild, EndChild, PushStyleColor, PopStyleColor,
//      PushStyleVarFloat, PushStyleVarVec2, PopStyleVar,
//      PushItemWidth, PopItemWidth, SetCursorPosX, GetCursorPosX,
//      BeginTable, TableNextColumn, EndTable, IsItemClicked,
//      GetWindowWidth, GetWindowHeight, Dummy.
//      Also wired SetWindowFontScale which was declared but not populated.
//      MIN remains 34.
//      -- Mass expansion of IModLoaderImGui — added ~100 additional ImGui
//      functions covering: window queries, scroll, groups, extended cursor
//      control, all drag/slider variants, listbox, tab bar, menus, popups,
//      tooltips, full table API, item state predicates, disabled regions,
//      clip rect, mouse queries, color utilities, and misc helpers.
//      MIN remains 34.
//      --- Added MakeTextKey to IPluginTextUtils (trampoline for FTextKey::FTextKey),
//      letting plugins build the Namespace/Key FTextKey arguments required by
//      AsLocalizable_Advanced.  MIN remains 34.
// v36: Replaced IPluginClientSessionInfo with IPluginNetModeInfo (server + client,
//      null on generic). The old offset-based UCrSessionSubsystem reads were
//      replaced with an AOB-resolved trampoline to AActor::InternalGetNetMode,
//      exposed via the new EPluginNetMode enum (mirrors engine ENetMode) so
//      plugins can compare against typed names instead of raw integers.
//      MIN should be bumped, but no one is using it yet.
//      --- Added object/package lookup address resolvers to IPluginEngineEvents:
//      GetStaticFindObjectByPathAddress, GetStaticFindObjectByNameAddress,
//      GetStaticFindObjectSafeByPathAddress, GetStaticFindObjectSafeByNameAddress,
//      GetStaticFindObjectFastAddress, GetFindPackageAddress,
//      GetPackageFullyLoadAddress, GetLoadPackageAddress,
//      GetAssetDataFastGetAssetAddress -- AOB-resolved during early modloader
//      startup (Hooks::ObjectLookup), exposed as raw trampoline addresses.
//      MIN remains 34.
// v37: Added IPluginImGuiTextures (client only, null on server/generic).
//      Lets plugins load images from file or memory (WIC: PNG/JPG/BMP/GIF/TIFF),
//      from raw RGBA pixels, or directly from a live SDK::UTexture2D*, and render
//      them via Image/ImageButton without any direct D3D12 access.
//      Up to 64 textures may be live at once.
//      hooks->ImGuiTextures->{LoadFromFile, LoadFromMemory, LoadFromRGBA,
//      LoadFromUTexture2D, FreeTexture, GetSize, Image, ImageButton}.
//      LoadFromUTexture2D copies the engine texture to a modloader-owned resource.
//      MIN remains 34.
// v38: IPluginImGuiTextures: raised texture slot cap 64 -> 2048.
//      Added GetFreeSlotCount(), GetCapacity().
//      Load functions now throw std::out_of_range when all slots are in use
//      (previously returned nullptr silently).
//      LoadFromUTexture2D now gates on FD3D12Resource::DefaultResourceState --
//      returns nullptr (without throwing) when streaming is still in flight.
//      Image/ImageButton silently skip rendering if the engine resource is not
//      yet in a shader-readable state (same check, re-evaluated each draw call).
//      MIN remains 34.
// v39: All Load* functions now take a mandatory name parameter (const char*).
//      The name is logged when the texture is rendered and on load errors to
//      make it easier to identify which texture is causing problems.
//      LoadFromUTexture2D now copies the engine texture to a modloader-owned
//      resource, so the handle survives engine GC/eviction.  Plugins must call
//      FreeTexture when done; handles are no longer auto-expired each frame.
//      MIN remains 34.
// v40: Added IPluginSplash (client only, null on server/generic).
//      Lets plugins push status messages and progress updates to the startup
//      splash window during PluginInit, giving users feedback when a plugin
//      takes several seconds to initialise.
//      hooks->Splash->{SetStatus, SetProgress, SetSubStatus, SetSubProgress, ClearSubBar}.
//      All text parameters are UTF-8 const char* (converted to wchar internally).
//      Safe to call from PluginInit; no-ops on server/generic builds.
//      MIN remains 34.
// v41: Added AcquireSplashHold / ReleaseSplashHold to IPluginSplash.
//      Lets plugins that PostToGameThread during PluginInit keep the splash
//      open until the async work completes.  Call AcquireSplashHold before
//      returning from PluginInit, then ReleaseSplashHold when the game-thread
//      callback finishes.  The init thread waits up to 30 s for all holds to
//      drain before closing the splash.  Safe to call from any thread.
//      MIN remains 34.
// v42: Needed version bump as game updated
// v43: Added IPluginUIEvents::RegisterOnPanelWindowClosed /
//      UnregisterOnPanelWindowClosed -- fires PluginPanelClosedCallback(handle)
//      when a panel window is closed, either via the ImGui titlebar X button
//      or via a plugin calling SetPanelClose.
//      Added IPluginUIEvents::AcquireInputCapture / ReleaseInputCapture --
//      lets any plugin request that the modloader suppress game mouse/
//      keyboard input (same as while a panel/modloader window is open),
//      independent of panel/widget state. Reference-counted via opaque
//      tokens; input stays suppressed until every acquired token is released.
//      MIN remains 42 (additive fields appended to IPluginUIEvents).
// v44: Added IPluginCraftingEvents (hooks->Crafting) -- RegisterOnCraftingFinished /
//      UnregisterOnCraftingFinished, fired by ACrCrafter::NativeOnItemCraftingComplete
//      (AOB-resolved native signal handler, not a UFUNCTION) whenever any crafting
//      building (Crafter, Forge, Refinery, Factory, Assembler, Exporter,
//      FoodProcessor, ItemPrinter, etc.) finishes crafting an item. Callback
//      receives the ACrCrafter* (as void*), its UCrCraftingComponent* (as void*,
//      may be null), and the crafter's FMassEntityHandle Index/SerialNumber.
//      Added CraftingFinished() to IPluginNativePointers (appended at end).
//      hooks->Crafting is appended at the end of IPluginHooks (not inserted
//      in the middle) to preserve struct layout for v42/v43 plugins.
//      MIN remains 42.
// v45: IPluginImGuiTextures texture slot cap raised 2048 -> 4096.
//      Textures are now shared and refcounted by name (case-insensitive):
//      if Load* is called with a name that matches an already-loaded,
//      in-use texture, the existing GPU resource is reused and its
//      refcount is incremented instead of creating a new copy. Each
//      successful Load* call must be paired with exactly one FreeTexture
//      call; the underlying resource is only released once the refcount
//      reaches zero. Plugins sharing a texture name must ensure the
//      underlying image data is identical -- the first registration wins.
//      MIN remains 42.
// v46: New game update, min/max bump
// v47: Added IPluginObjectWalker (hooks->ObjectWalker) -- walks SDK::UObject::
//      GObjects on demand and lets plugins find objects by class/object name
//      and invoke a UFunction on one by name via ProcessEvent. On-demand only
//      (every call walks tens of thousands of GObjects entries synchronously);
//      there is no hook into UObject construction, so nothing fires live as
//      objects spawn -- callers must trigger a walk and cache results.
//      InvokeUFunctionByName/InvokeResolvedUFunction perform no parameter
//      marshaling: paramsBuffer must already match the target UFunction's
//      native Params layout, since this SDK dump exposes no params-size field
//      to validate against. Appended at the end of IPluginHooks to preserve
//      layout for existing plugins. MIN remains 46.
//      --- Added IPluginDelegateHook (hooks->Delegate) -- lets a plugin
//      splice a synthetic UFunction into an existing UE5 multicast delegate
//      (e.g. SDK::UCrSaveSubsystem::OnAfterSave) and get a parameterless
//      callback when it broadcasts, without the maintainer hand-writing a
//      dedicated AOB-scanned hook module for it. Never touches a real
//      UClass's FuncMap/AllFunctionsCache, so other code resolving the same
//      function name by name is unaffected. Multiple concurrent hooks,
//      including several on the same delegate, are supported via opaque
//      DelegateHookHandle values. Appended at the end of IPluginHooks.
//      v47 is unreleased, so this and IPluginObjectWalker land in the same
//      version; MIN remains 46.
//      --- IPluginObjectWalker reworked while still unreleased (no plugins
//      built against the visitor-based shape yet): WalkAllObjects /
//      FindObjectsByClassName / FindObjectsByName replaced with *Into
//      variants that fill a plugin-owned PluginObjectInfo buffer instead of
//      invoking a callback -- no allocation crosses the DLL boundary in
//      either direction. Each takes a PluginObjectLookupMode to filter
//      CDOs/archetypes out of GObjects without the plugin needing to know
//      raw EObjectFlags bit values. Return value is the total match count
//      (may exceed capacity; caller can re-call with a bigger buffer if
//      truncated). FindFirstObjectByName/InvokeUFunctionByName/
//      ResolveUFunction/InvokeResolvedUFunction are unchanged.
//      --- Added IPluginObjectProperties (hooks->ObjectProperties) --
//      resolves a UPROPERTY/FProperty by class name + property name (walks
//      the live UClass's ChildProperties + SuperStruct chain), then reads/
//      writes it through typed accessors (Bool/Int/Float/Object) or a raw
//      escape hatch (GetPropertyRawPtr). Because FProperty::Offset is looked
//      up fresh against the running build's reflection metadata every call,
//      a game update that reshuffles struct layout does not require
//      touching any plugin that goes through this interface instead of
//      casting raw SDK structs and reading at a compiled-in offset -- only
//      the property *name* needs to stay the same.
//      String/Name properties are read-only (FString/FName own their own
//      backing storage; writing one in place safely needs the engine's own
//      allocator, out of scope here). Does not cover plain native C++
//      members with no UPROPERTY/FProperty entry -- those have no reflection
//      metadata to look up by name. v47 is unreleased, so this lands in the
//      same version as IPluginObjectWalker/IPluginDelegateHook above.
//      Appended at the end of IPluginHooks. MIN remains 46.
// v48: Added ImDrawList direct-drawing access to IModLoaderImGui (appended at
//      the end of the struct, so existing v34+ plugins keep working unchanged).
//      GetWindowDrawList/GetBackgroundDrawList/GetForegroundDrawList return an
//      opaque PluginDrawList (== ImDrawList*) handle valid for the current
//      frame only -- do not cache it across frames. Covers shape primitives
//      (Line, Rect(Filled), RectFilledMultiColor, Quad(Filled),
//      Triangle(Filled), Circle(Filled), Ngon(Filled), Ellipse(Filled),
//      Text/TextSized, Polyline, ConvexPolyFilled, BezierCubic/Quadratic),
//      images via existing PluginTextureHandle (Image, ImageQuad,
//      ImageRounded), the stateful Path* builder API (PathClear/LineTo/ArcTo/
//      ArcToFast/EllipticalArcTo/BezierCubicCurveTo/BezierQuadraticCurveTo/
//      Rect/FillConvex/Stroke), and draw-list-local clip rect stack
//      (PushClipRect/PushClipRectFullScreen/PopClipRect/GetClipRectMin/Max).
//      Colors are packed 0xAABBGGRR ImU32 -- build them with the existing
//      GetColorU32FromVec4/GetColorU32FromCol helpers. MIN remains 46.
// v49: IPluginUIEvents::RegisterOnConfigChanged/UnregisterOnConfigChanged now
//      take a leading `const IPluginSelf* self` parameter, matching the
//      self-first convention already used by IPluginLogger/IPluginConfig.
//      self is the same pointer received in PluginInit -- pass it straight
//      through, no plugin-name string needed. The modloader uses it to scope
//      FireConfigChanged so a plugin's callback only fires for edits to its
//      own config file, instead of broadcasting every plugin's config
//      changes to every registered listener. Breaking signature change:
//      MIN bumped to 49.

// v50 - 29/07/2026: Added IPluginDebugDraw, reachable as hooks->HUD->DebugDraw
//      (client only -- the whole HUD interface is null on server/generic).
//      Reimplements all sixteen UKismetSystemLibrary::DrawDebug* nodes, which
//      are dead on this shipping build: ENABLE_DRAW_DEBUG is 0, so every body
//      compiled away to nothing and only the exec thunks survive, parsing
//      their parameters off the FFrame and returning without drawing. The
//      DrawDebugType pin on the trace nodes is inert for the same reason. What
//      is still alive is the renderer -- UWorld::LineBatchers[4] (all four
//      NewObject'd and registered by UWorld::UpdateWorldComponents) and
//      ULineBatchComponent::DrawLines -- so this builds the same geometry and
//      hands it to the engine's own batchers via a new AOB-scanned hook module
//      (hooks/game/debug_draw/).
//      Covers Line, Point, Circle, Sphere, Box, Capsule, Cylinder,
//      ConeInDegrees, Arrow, CoordinateSystem, Plane, Frustum, Camera (both an
//      ACameraActor* form and a location/rotation/FOV form), String,
//      FloatHistoryTransform and FloatHistoryLocation, plus FlushPersistentLines
//      and ClearAllStrings.
//      DrawString takes a trailing fontScale (1.0f = the engine's small font at
//      native size; the engine applies it with no distance falloff). Added
//      while v50 was still unreleased, so the signature was amended in place
//      rather than appending a second function -- no plugin has been built
//      against the earlier shape.
//      Two primitives deviate from the engine because only DrawLines survived
//      as an out-of-line function: DrawPoint (engine uses BatchedPoints) is a
//      three-axis cross, and DrawPlane / the float-history graphs (engine uses
//      BatchedMeshes) draw outlines instead of filled quads.
//      Callable from any thread: the batchers are game-thread only, but the
//      wrappers copy every argument and defer to GameThreadDispatch when the
//      caller is elsewhere, so drawing from an ImGui panel callback (which
//      runs on the render thread) just works.
//      The new field is appended at the end of IPluginHUDEvents and all the
//      geometry structs are new, so nothing existing shifts: MIN remains 49.

// v51: Added IPluginUIEvents::AcquireInputPassthrough / ReleaseInputPassthrough
//      -- a cooperative counterpart to the v43 AcquireInputCapture pair.
//      AcquireInputCapture is all-or-nothing: while a token is held the game
//      receives no mouse or keyboard input at all. That is right for a modal
//      settings panel and wrong for an always-on widget UI the player is meant
//      to keep playing underneath (a timeline editor, a build planner, an
//      overlay with draggable handles) -- those currently freeze the player out
//      until the window is closed. A passthrough token instead puts the
//      modloader in cooperative mode: ImGui is fed every message and draws and
//      owns the cursor exactly as before, but the game is only cut out of the
//      input classes ImGui actually wants that frame -- mouse while the cursor
//      is over an ImGui window or dragging a widget (io.WantCaptureMouse), and
//      keyboard while a text field has focus (io.WantCaptureKeyboard /
//      WantTextInput). Everything else, including the WM_INPUT raw-mouse deltas
//      UE5 uses for camera look, reaches the game untouched.
//      Exclusive capture always wins: while any modloader window, plugin panel
//      or v43 capture token is active, passthrough tokens have no effect and
//      behaviour is exactly what it was before. Tokens are refcounted across
//      all plugins the same way, and must be released in PluginShutdown.
//      Appended at the end of IPluginUIEvents, so nothing existing shifts:
//      MIN remains 49.

// v52: Added IModLoaderImGui::GetMouseWheel / GetMouseWheelH. The v36 mouse
//      query block covers buttons, position, dragging and hovering but never
//      exposed the wheel, so a plugin drawing its own scrollable or zoomable
//      surface (a timeline, a map, a graph) had no way to read it at all --
//      ImGui consumes the WM_MOUSEWHEEL itself and the plugin never sees the
//      message. Both return the per-frame delta straight off ImGuiIO, in the
//      usual ImGui units (one notch = 1.0). Appended at the end of the
//      function table, which is append-only: MIN remains 49.

// Interface for loading and rendering images without direct D3D12 access.
// Retrieved via hooks->ImGuiTextures (client only; nullptr on server/generic).
//
// THREADING RULES
// ---------------
// Load* functions perform a blocking GPU copy and MUST be called from a game-
// thread callback (OnExperienceLoadComplete, OnWorldBeginPlay, PluginInit, etc.)
// -- NOT from inside an ImGui render callback.  Calling them from the render
// thread blocks the GPU pipeline and will cause crashes with Streamline/DLSS.
//
// Typical usage pattern:
//   OnExperienceLoadComplete  ->  handle = LoadFromUTexture2D(tex, "MyTex")
//   ImGui render callback     ->  Image(handle, w, h)
//   PluginShutdown            ->  FreeTexture(handle)
//
// Image/ImageButton must be called from inside a plugin render callback while
// an ImGui frame is in progress.  FreeTexture must not be called while the
// texture may still be in flight on the GPU (i.e. not from the render callback
// on the same frame you stop using it -- wait one frame or call from game thread).
//
// Up to GetCapacity() textures may be live at once.
// All Load* functions take a mandatory name parameter for log identification.
// They throw std::out_of_range if no slots are available.
// They return NULL (without throwing) only when D3D12 is not yet ready or
// when the specific resource cannot be loaded (bad file, null pointer, etc.).
// Call GetFreeSlotCount() before loading if you need to avoid the exception.
//
// Sharing/refcounting (v45): the name is also used as a sharing key
// (case-insensitive). If any Load* call is made with a name that matches an
// already-loaded, in-use texture, the existing GPU resource is reused and its
// refcount is incremented -- no new slot is consumed and no new GPU work is
// done. Every successful Load* call (whether it created a new texture or
// reused an existing one) must be paired with exactly one FreeTexture call;
// the underlying resource is only released once the refcount drops to zero.
// If multiple plugins use the same name, they must be referring to the same
// image -- the first registration's pixel data wins.
